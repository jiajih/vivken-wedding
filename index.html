              Kenny grew up in a small town called Kalamazoo, Michigan. After going to college at the University of Michigan (Go Blue!), he moved to the bay area and has never left. After working in consulting for five years, Ken decided to get his dual MBA/MPH at Berkeley (where he met Viv!) and is now working for a digital health company called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.omadahealth.com">Omada Health</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              A fan and player of futbol, Ken keeps busy with his intermural soccer team and regular yoga practice. He enjoys his friday 'Rubios &amp; Movie' nights with Viv and the many travel adventures they've had.

              Vivien comes from the warm, sunny island of Singapore. She left home at 18 to attend college at UCLA (Go Bruins!) and has enjoyed every minute of her journey. After Westwood, Viv pursued her masters in New York and decided to work there for the next 5 years. Alas, her heart belonged to California and that's when she headed to Berkeley. She's currently loving her job at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.quid.com">Quid</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Viv loves spending her free time in the kitchen testing out her recipes on Kenny. She hopes they will explore their new neighborhood with more hikes.

          Vivien and Kenny first met at Days at Haas 2 in April 2011 over a hosted dinner but didn't get close till the end of the first semester. Despite much encouragement from their friends, the two stayed friends for most of their first year. However, after a serendipitous viewing of Step-Up (yes, the dance movie), the two realized they were no longer just friends. 

          <h3>The Engagement</h3>
          In April 2014, Viv &amp; Kenny went down to San Diego to visit their friends, Joe and Vanessa (of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vanessanicoleengagementrings.com">Vanessa Nicole Jewels</a>) to have an engagement ring designed. Kenny wanted the proposal to be a surprise, so he casually mentioned that he didn't know when the ring would be ready so Viv would think it wouldn't be ready for a while.

          Kenny found out that Viv wanted photos of their engagement and enlisted the help of their friend Gloria. They figured the best way to have Gloria bring a camera but not be conspicuous was to go to the zoo together. On that faithful Saturday in May, the three of them met up at the Oakland Zoo. Viv was cluelessly exploring the animals while Kenny and Gloria were scheming for a location. Eventually, they found the perfect spot at the baboons (yes, baboons) exhibit. With an above ground walkway ending in a gazebo and no one around, Gloria cued Kenny with "let's take a photo". Right then, a random family interrupts the photo and plants themselves in the gazebo with no signs of moving. After awkwardly waiting a few minutes and Viv getting suspicious (esp. since the baboons had left), Kenny and Gloria decide to move on. When they round the corner, they find an area with beautiful pink and red flowers and quickly move forward with the plan. Kenny says only four words before Viv realizes what's happening and starts bawling. She did not hear the rest of the story, or even hear the question, and barely sees a shiny red box in Kenny's hands. Through blurry eyes she grabs the shiny ring and tries to put it on to which Kenny has to confirm, "So I guess that's a Yes?"...Yes indeed. </p>

            Join us for some sun, BBQ and volleyball at the beach where Viv spent many winters while growing up.

We'll set up on the east end of the park (by Magic Island) near the volleyball courts. There will be burgers, hot dogs and beverages provided, and we'll welcome any additional snacks or beverages. Come by to hang out, grab a bite or simply take a dip in the warm Hawaiian waters.

        Many of you will probably start heading home on Sunday and probably want to squeeze in all your last minute activites and shopping. So we are keeping it simple. Assuming we get ourselves out of bed after the crazy night of partying, we will plant ourselves at the Tiki's Bar and Grill (located right at the Aston Waikiki Hotel) and snack on some pupu platters. Come by and say hi (or bye) before you guys head out!

          For those who are unable to take advantage of the Wedding Wings program, Ken and I are big fans of using Kayak(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.kayak.com">https://www.kayak.com</a>) to find affordable fares. United Airlines have many flights daily from many mainland cities. For those with more complicated or international travel, Hipmunk(<a target="_blank" href="https://www.hipmunk.com">https://www.Hipmunk.com</a>) could be a great alternative.

            Like all the other islands of Hawaii, there are plenty of hikes in Oahu that have beautiful ocean, waterfall or forest views. They range from gradual to challenging, so whatever you have an appetite for, there is a hike for you. A couple of our favorites are the Makapu'u Point Lighthouse Trail (you might even catch some whales migrating in Oct) and the Diamond Head Trail. For our 'Lost' fans, we definitely recommend the Manoa Falls hike.

          Those are some of our favorites activities to do in Honolulu, but here are some other ideas:
          <li>
            Visit the <a href="http://www.gonorthshore.org/attractions.htm">North Shore</a> and watch surfers ride some crazy waves. You can even take a surf lessions there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taste some fresh and delicious pineapples(and pineapple ice cream) at the <a href="http://www.dole-plantation.com/">Dole Plantation</a> on your drive up to (or from) the North Shore. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn more about King Kamehameha and many generations of royal Hawaiian families when they lived in (and some ruled from) <a href="http://www.iolanipalace.org/">Iolani Palace</a>. 
          </li>
          <li>
            From <a href="http://www.kailuachamber.com/beaches">Lanikai to Kailua</a>, get some sun in some of the other beaches Oahu has to offer.
          </li> 
          <li>
            If you enjoy shopping, there is no mall more beautiful that <a href="http://www.alamoanacenter.com/">Ala Moana Shopping Center</a> with its open-air design and center stage hula performances.

        For those of you who know us well, you know how much we love our food! So we want to share some of our favorite places with you so you can enjoy a local taste of Hawaii.

            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zippys.com/">Zippy's</a><br>
            Any trip to Honolulu would not be complete without a trip to Zippy's for Viv &amp; Kenny. With some of the best mac salad and spam musubis on the island, you do not want to miss this place. A well-established local chain, you can experience some great plates lunches at any of its locations. Viv's favorite is the Korean Fried Chicken mini plate! Make sure you are eating at the take-out/quick-dining locations, not the sit-down restaurants. <br>

            <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yamasfishmarket.com/">Yama's Fish Market</a><br>
            Hawaii is known for its abundance of fresh and incredibly delicious tuna. The best way to enjoy this delightful fish is with 'poke' (pronounced poe-key). It's a light mixture of chunks of raw tuna with the basic mixture of shoyu and onions. At Yama's, you can find many variations including seaweed (limu), fish roe (masago) and octopus (tako). But don't stop at poke here, you can get lomi lomi salmon (salmon marinated in citrus), chicken long rice (ground chicken with vermicelli), and lau lau (pork cooked in taro leaves)! <br>

            When you mention Hawaiian food, people tend to ask about the famous shrimp trucks in the North Shore. Now there's in the reknown <a href="http://www.giovannisshrimptruck.com/">Giovanni's Shrimp Truck</a> that's famous for their garlic shrimp. However, if you were at the Haleiwa location, just two trucks away is our favorite food truck. Now Hui Ohana might be a 'Shrimp Truck' by name, but man, they make a mean (and giant) fish 'n chips. They use locally raise catfish for their fish, and its served with homemade tartar sauce that is amazing <br>

            3660 on the Rise is one of Viv's family's favorite restaurant in all of Hawaii, especially for Viv's Dad (who can picky about his fish). Known for its blend of European and Asian cuisines, the food at 3660 is really a style of its own. With some of the most innovative dishes you'll find in Honolulu, we know you won't be disappointed. Viv's favorites dishes are the ahi katsu appetizer and soy sake butterfish, though she does love the taro bread that comes with your meal!
